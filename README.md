## Usage

First clone this repository to your computer. You must have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/docs/install) installed.

```bash
cd ~/code/<your_github_nickname>
# ⚠⚠⚠ CHANGE IT TO THE NAME YOU WANT TO GIVE ⚠⚠⚠
git clone git@github.com:jramiresbrito/javascript-select.git NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT
cd NAME_OF_YOUR_PROJECT
rm -rf .git
yarn install
# Open it in your Text Editor
code . # For VsCode users
stt # For Sublime Text users
```

Make sure you have `./node_modules/.bin` in your `$PATH`! This way you can run this:

```bash
eslint lib
webpack-dev-server
```

Now you can start your dev server:

```bash
webpack-dev-server
```

If you don't have any other process using the port 8080, webpack will make use of it. Always check which port dev server is using.

```bash
check you project in http://localhost:8080
```
